# How does the web work?
 HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason. hat first part of a webpage tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.
 <br>
 The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to. 
 <br>
 A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser...
 <br>
 Representations is one of these things that doesn't get used a lot. In most cases, a resource has only a single representation. But we're hoping that representations will be used more in the future because there's a bunch of new formats popping up all over the place.

## how do the machines tell each other where things are?
 The URL, of course. If everything that machines need to talk about has a corresponding URL, you've created the machine equivalent of a noun. That you and I and the rest of the world have agreed on talking about nouns in a certain way is pretty important.
 <br>
 Machines don't have a universal noun - that's why they suck. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns.

## Verbs and pronouns and adjectives
 Verbs are important. There's a powerful concept in programming and CS theory called “polymorphism”. That's a geeky way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them.
