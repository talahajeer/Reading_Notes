 $("selector").method("param");

 jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 

## jQuery .ready()
 jQuery's .ready() method checks if the browser supports the DOMcontentLoaded event and runs after the DOM has loaded.

 <br>
 Here are four methods that update the content of all elements in a jQuery selection . 
 <br>
 . html() 
 This method gives every element in the matched set the same new content. The new content may include HTML. 
 <br>
 .replaceWith() 
 This method replaces every element in a matched set with new content. It also returns the replaced elements. 
 <br>
 . text() 
 This method gives every element in the matched set the same new text content. Any markup would be shown as text. 
 <br>
 . remove() 
 This method removes all of the elements in the matched set. 

 # Pair Programming
 Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
 The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
