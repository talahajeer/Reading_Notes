# Node.JS

## What is Node.JS?
 Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

 This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

##  Check your Node.JS
1. download node 
2. run node -v in your terminal
3. create new fie called hello.js
4. type a code console.log("hello,world") in the file
5. run node hello.js in your terminal
6. hello,world message will appear in the terminal

Your node works perfectly.

## What is npm?
 Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.

 In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week. Let’s take a quick look at how we would use npm to install a package.

## Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server
 Next we come to one of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server. This isn’t a new concept, and was first attempted by Netscape way back in 1994. Node.js, however, is the first implementation to gain any real traction, and it provides some unique benefits, compared to traditional languages. Node now plays a critical role in the technology stack of many high-profile companies. Let’s have a look at what those benefits are.
