# When Women stopped Coding

 Modern computer science is dominated by men. But it hasn't always been this way.

 A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

 What happened?

 We spent the past few weeks trying to answer this question, and there's no clear, single answer.

 But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

 These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

 This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company?

 Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

 * Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.
 * Diverse companies perform better.
 * Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
 * It’s the right thing to do.
