## Comparison Operators:
 1. "==" is equal to (It checks the value only)
 
 2. "===" strict equal to (It checks the value and the datatype)
 
 3. "!=" is not equal to (It checks the value only)
 
 4. "!==" strict not equal to (It checks the value and the datatype)
 
 5. ">" Greater than
 
 6. "<" Less than 
 
 7. ">=" greater than or equal to
 
 8. "<=" less than or equal to
 
## Logical Operators:
 1. "&&" logical AND 
 2. "||" logical OR
 3. "!" logical NOT


## Loops:
 Loops check a conditon. If it returns TRUE a code block will run. It will keep checking the condition till it returns FALSE, then it will beak out the loop.

## Types of Loops:
 1. FOR: 
     This loop runs for a certain known number of times.
     
     ex:
     for (var i = 0; i< num ; i++){
         statment;
     } 

 2. WHILE:
     This loop runs for unknown times for the coder till it returns False.
     
     ex:
     while (var i = 0; i< num ; i++){
         statment;
     }
