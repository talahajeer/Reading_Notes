# Website Design

To start your website designing there is few things to take in mind before:

  1. Who is this website for?
  you have to know your audiance first by:
    1. gender
    2. age
    3. location
    4. ocuupation
    5. income
    6. web use

 2. Why people visit your site?    
 Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

  3. What your visitors are trying to achieve? 
 This information can help guide your site designs.

 4. What information your visitors need.
 You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively. 

 5. How often will people visit your website.
 Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static. 


Now, you build up your **site map** with all the headlines and sub-headlines.

Draw a sketch or a **wirefram** and start structuring the website.


Now you need a brief about HTML 
 1. HTML pages are text documents.
 2. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
 3. Tags are often referred to as elements.
 4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
 5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
 6. Attributes require a name and a value ex: lang = "fr".
 7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

#### HTML traditional layouts
For a long time, web page authors used div elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the div element in the structure of the page.


#### New HTML5 layout elements
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.


#### DOCTYPE
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.


#### Comments in HTML
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
<!-- comment goes here -->
It is a good idea to add comments to your code because, no matter how familiar you are with the page at the time of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand.


#### ID Attribute
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).
