# Website Design

To start your website designing there is few things to take in mind before:

  1. Who is this website for?
  you have to know your audiance first by:
    1. gender
    2. age
    3. location
    4. ocuupation
    5. income
    6. web use

 2. Why people visit your site?    
 Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

  3. What your visitors are trying to achieve? 
 This information can help guide your site designs.

 4. What information your visitors need.
 You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively. 

 5. How often will people visit your website.
 Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static. 


Now, you build up your **site map** with all the headlines and sub-headlines.

Draw a sketch or a **wirefram** and start structuring the website.


Now you need a brief about HTML 
 1. HTML pages are text documents.
 2. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
 3. Tags are often referred to as elements.
 4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end  ex: <p> </p>.
 5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element ex: <p lang = "fr"> this will specify the language of the paragraph in french.
 6. Attributes require a name and a value ex: lang = "fr".
 7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
