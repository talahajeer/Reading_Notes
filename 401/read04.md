# Objects and Classes
 Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

 You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class. 

## Accessing Object Functions
 To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable.

## Thinking Recursively in Python
 A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
 This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

## Recursive Data Structures in Python
 A data structure is recursive if it can be deÔ¨Åned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure. Let me demonstrate. Assume that you have only an empty list at your disposal
