# What is a Stack?
 A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

## Common terminology for a stack is

 * Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
 * Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
 * Top - This is the top of the stack.
 * Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
 * IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

 * Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
 * Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

 * Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
