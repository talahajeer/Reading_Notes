# TTD:
 stands for Test-Driven Development, which is the design step for tests on the code
 ## Unit  tests:
 actual tests on input/output that were designed using TTDs
 * It is best to test iour code n the straight forward test case, and to separate the test code from our original code for better file management 
 * Use the AAA concept: Arrange the input, Act (execute), Assert(check output)

# Recursion is a concept to repeat a certain task.
 It is a concept found in mathematics as well as programming
 While running a recursive function, the stack (memory part) is used to have the first data in, to be the last out
 There are tailed recursion (the recursive call is at the end) and non tailed recursion (the opposite)
 There are direct recursion (the function keeps calling itself) and indirect recursion (the function may call other functions repeatedly)
