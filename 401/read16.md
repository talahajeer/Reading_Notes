# Machine learning
 Machine learning is not about algorithms.

 When you open a textbook or a university syllabus, you'll often be greeted by a grocery list of algorithms.

 This has fueled the misconception that machine learning is about mastering dozens of algorithms. However, it's much more than that...

 Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems...

 ...and individual algorithms are only one piece of the puzzle. The rest of the puzzle is how you apply them the right way.

 ## Machine Learning Tasks
     Academic machine learning starts with and focuses on individual algorithms. However, in applied machine learning, you should first pick the right machine learning task for the job.

 * A task is a specific objective for your algorithms.
 * Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.
 * In fact, you should always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won't know which one will perform best for your dataset.
     The two most common categories of tasks are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. (There are other tasks as well, but the concepts you'll learn in this course will be widely applicable.)
