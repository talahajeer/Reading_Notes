# JavaScript 

## What is a Script?
 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step. A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page. Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.

## To write a script:
 You need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve. Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 


## How does JavaScript work?
1. ACCESS CONTENT:
  You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:
 * Select the text inside all of the h1 elements on a page
 * Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
 * Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of emai1 

2. MODIFY CONTENT:
 You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
 * Add a paragraph of text after the first hl element
 * Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
 * Change the size or position of an img element

3. PROGRAM RULES:
 You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
 * A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
 * A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments.
 * An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport). 

4. REACT TO EVENTS:
 You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
 * A button is pressed
 * A link is clicked (or tapped) on
 * A cursor hovers over an element
 * Information is added to a form
 * An interval of time has passed
 * A web page has finished loading

So, basically JavaScript gives you the ability to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser. How?
 - Access the content of the page
 - Modify the content of the page
 - Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
 - React to events triggered by the user or browser

## Expressions:
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
 * Expressions that jsut assign a value to a variable.
 * EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.

 ## Operators:
  * Assignment operators. =
  * Arithmatic operators. + - % / * ....
  * String operators. + 
  * Comparison operators. < > = == ...
  * Logical Operators. && ...
