## HTML elements 
 HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (headings: h1 h2 .., paragraphs p,navigation nav,...).

## CSS color
 What are the selectors? (they specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements. Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, style= "color: black"; 

 CSS rules usually appear in a separate document (stylesheet.css), although they may appear within an HTML page with (style) tag and the inline too.

## JavaScript
 A script is made up of a series of statements. Scripts contain very precise instructions.For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 
 
 var x = 5;

 
 Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
 
 var x = 5;

 JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

 Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.

 Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

 Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
