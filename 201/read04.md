# HTML links
To link other webpages to our webpage we use
<br>
a tag
<br>
Between the opening tag and the closing tag we put the word to be linked.
<br>
The attribute href is used to place the link of the other webpage.
<br>
If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.


# HTML Layouts
div elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
<br>
Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
<br>
The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)



# JavaScript Functions:
## What is a function?
 Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

## Declaring a function:
 To create a function you give it a name then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
    
    function funName(){
        code;
    }

## calling a function:
 Having declared the function you can the execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code wich known as CALLING a function.

    funName();     

## Declaring functions that need information:
  Sometimes a function needs a specific information to perform its task. In such case you declare a function and give it PARAMETERS.
   
   function area(width,height){
        code;
        return width*height;
    }
### To call such function:
     area(3,5);


# Pair Programming
 Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
 The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
