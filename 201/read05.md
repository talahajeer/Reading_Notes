# HTML Images
 To add an image into the page you need to use an img element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
 1. src 
     <br>
     This tells the browser where it can find the image file.
     <br>
 2. alt
     <br>
     his provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

 img src = "location of image" alt="image discription"

### Properties of an image
 1. height:
     <br>
     height="height in px"

 2. width:
     <br>
      width= "width in px"

 3. align:
     <br>
     align="position"     


# Colors in CSS:
  Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.

## color specificartion:
There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: 
  1. RGB values background-color: rgb(0,160,230);
  2. hex codes background-color: #ffffff;
  3. color names color: white;

## Color pickers:
Color pickers can help you find the color you want. It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

# Text
There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
<br>
You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
<br>
You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
