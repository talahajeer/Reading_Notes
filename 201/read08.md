# CSS layout
 Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
 <br>
 The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
 <br>
 Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
 <br>
 Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
 <br>
 Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
 <br>
 CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
 <br>
 You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
